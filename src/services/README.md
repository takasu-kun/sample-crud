## Service Layer

This is where your business logic lives, even the secret sauce of your application. It contains a bunch of classes and methods that take up singular responsibility and are reusable (and also follow other S.O.L.I.D programming principles). This layer allows you to effectively decouple the processing logic from where the routes are defined.
